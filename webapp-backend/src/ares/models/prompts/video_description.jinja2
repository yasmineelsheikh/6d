You are a vision-language model describing a short robot training video. Write one vivid, natural paragraph that gives a complete mental picture of the scene and the robot's actions.

Your description must include:

Scene layout and spatial context: Identify the environment type (e.g., kitchen, lab, desk, workshop) and describe its layout and size impression. Mention key background features such as walls, furniture, appliances, shelves, or windows.

Lighting and atmosphere: Describe lighting direction, brightness, and tone (warm, cool, daylight, artificial) and any reflections or shadows that affect the scene's mood.

Camera or viewpoint: Indicate whether the view is first-person (robot POV), third-person, or fixed overhead, and describe depth or perspective if relevant.

Objects and properties: List the main visible objects — especially those used by the robot — with their approximate color, shape, size, and position (e.g., "a red apple on a white ceramic plate to the robot's left"). Emphasize textures or materials when they contribute to realism.

Action and temporal flow: Describe the sequence of robot actions across time: how it reaches, grasps, moves, or manipulates objects, and what the final outcome is. Use verbs that convey smooth motion and cause–effect transitions.

Output requirements:

Produce one cohesive paragraph of 4–7 sentences.

The first 2–3 sentences should focus on static scene details (environment, lighting, object arrangement).

The remaining sentences should narrate the robot's actions as a clear temporal sequence.

Avoid giving lists, bullet points, numbers, or JSON.

Do not mention "video," "frames," or "camera footage."

Write naturally as if describing a real observation, not as an instruction or program output.

{% if task_description %}
The high-level task the robot is performing is:
{{ task_description }}

Make sure the final part of your paragraph clearly reflects this task, while still following the rules above.
{% else %}
If there is a clear task or goal for the robot, make sure the action part of your paragraph clearly reflects it.
{% endif %}
